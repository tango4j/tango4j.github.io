## About me

I am working as a Deep Learning Applied Scientist of conversational AI team at NVIDIA, where I work on speaker diarization and speech recognition for NVIDIA's conversational AI system. 

Previously, I received my MS in Computer Science and PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Southern California, where I worked with Shrikanth Narayanan on speaker diarization and speech signal processing. During my PhD I interned at CAPIO (now Twilio Inc), Amazon Alexa and Microsoft. 

Currently, my research focuses on speaker recognition in automatic speech recognition system.
